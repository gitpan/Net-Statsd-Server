Net::Statsd::Server - a Perl port of Etsy's statsd
==================================================

For the statsd client library, see Net::Statsd:

  https://metacpan.org/module/Net::Statsd

This instead is the server component of statsd.

== MOTIVATION ==

Why did I do this? For a few reasons:

* Because I don't like adding node.js to our
  production stack just to run statsd.
* to learn how statsd was put together
* to learn AnyEvent
* to learn how to build a high performance UDP server
* to have some geek fun

Basically, to learn :-)

== THANKS ==

Many thanks to my awesome wife that coped with
me trying to write statsd in Perl in a weekend,
leaving barely any time for anything else.
