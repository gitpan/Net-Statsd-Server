Net::Statsd::Server::Changes - Change history for Net::Statsd::Server

=head2 Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.05   16th January 2013

  Improved UDP socket default settings to perform better.
    In my tests, Net::Statsd::Server manages to successfully capture
    almost twice the amount of UDP traffic (otherwise lost) than
    the original node.js based statsd, with SO_RCVBUF = 8Mb.
    I still have to experiment a bit more with this setting though.

=head2 Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.04   15th January 2013

  Fixed statistics flush. When a flush is triggered, stats have
    to be cleared. The flush code wasn't doing this previously.

  Fixed management commands (:8126) to output correct JSON data
    structures.

  This is the first fully functional statsd server release.

  First release on an unsuspecting world.
