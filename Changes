    Net::Statsd::Server::Changes - Change history for Net::Statsd::Server

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.16    6th May 2014
      Implemented new timer attributes: count_ps, median, sum_squares.

    Release of 0.15 never happened.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.14   25th April 2014
      Fixed problem with gauges that were erroneously deleted either
        when deleteIdleStats was false, or deleteIdleStats was true
        but deleteGauges was false.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.13   26th January 2014
      Added support for Perl 5.8, so now Net::Statsd::Server should
        in theory work on 5.8 too, thanks to RJBS for the related patch.
        RJBS also reported N::S::S to work on Solaris.

      Fixed RT#85165, now the code is indicated as Perl_5 licence.
        Problem there was my failed understanding of the interaction
        between hardcoded Makefile.PL and dzil.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.12  16th December 2013
      Fixed (hopefully) problems reported by CPAN testers:
        * Failing to setsockopt(SO_RCVBUF) is no more a fatal exception.
          We will just continue and emit a warning instead.
        * Some CPAN testers appear to have a running graphite on their
          systems, so use a not so common port instead of 2003.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.11  13th December 2013
      Added implementation for the following configuration directives:
        deleteIdleStats, deleteGauges, deleteSets, prefixStats.
        Both deleteTimers and deleteCounters were supposed to work
        before 0.11 too.

      Improved documentation. Should be clear now how to know what
        options are actually supported and what options are not.

      Improved integration tests. Now it's even easier to run
        Net::Statsd::Server integration tests against the nodejs
        version of statsd to verify full compatibility.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.10  10th February 2013
      Fixed SO_RCVBUF on Mac OS X, where it's apparently not possible
        to set SO_RCVBUF to more than 8Mb. If you're on OSX, I'd
        like to get more reports about this.

      Fixed integration test suite so that it always runs with the
        correct interpreter ($^X) instead of /usr/bin/perl.
        This should fix lots of CPAN testers failure reports.

      Improved internal trim() function.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.09   29th January 2013
      Fixed a few more nodejs-statsd compatibility bugs:
        - non-legacy namespace code added a repeated 'stats.' level
          that shouldn't be there
        - underscode character ('_') is now correctly allowed as
          part of a statsd metric.

      Added an integration test suite, to verify end-to-end that
        statsd server is behaving exactly as the nodejs version.
        Being as near to 100% compatibility as possible has been
        one of the main goals from the start.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.08   27th January 2013
      Fixed CPAN testers failures reported for inexact floating point
        comparison when testing standard deviation of timer results
        in the test suite.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.07   23rd January 2013
      Started converting the nodejs statsd test suite to TAP
        test cases. Completed the conversion of the metrics processing
        test cases. This uncovered two subtle bugs in the metrics class.

      Fixed bug in calculation of percentile values threshold, due
        to a difference in how Javascript's Math.round() and
        Perl's int() work.

      Fixed undefined value warning in the metrics processing during
        the calculation of cumulative values for timers, due to
        an off-by-one error.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.06   17th January 2013
      Added new File backend.
        It allows to flush all aggregated stats to a given log file.

      Added keyFlush implementation.
        Allows to have the top n% (keyFlush.percent) dumped to a
        log file (keyFlush.log) or stdout every y seconds
        (keyFlush.interval).

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.05   16th January 2013
      Improved UDP socket default settings to perform better.
        In my tests, Net::Statsd::Server manages to successfully capture
        almost twice the amount of UDP traffic (otherwise lost) than
        the original node.js based statsd, with SO_RCVBUF = 8Mb.
        I still have to experiment a bit more with this setting though.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.04   15th January 2013
      Fixed statistics flush. When a flush is triggered, stats have
        to be cleared. The flush code wasn't doing this previously.

      Fixed management commands (:8126) to output correct JSON data
        structures.

      This is the first fully functional statsd server release.

  Net::Statsd::Server 0.01 - 0.03            January 2013
      First release on an unsuspecting world.
